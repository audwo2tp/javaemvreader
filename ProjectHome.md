A tool to communicate with, and read data from an EMV smart card. Written in Java.
The primary purpose of this application is to read and parse all the openly accessible information (_**non-secure**_ data) on an EMV card. Support for transactions has not been implemented

Supported commands/functions:

|**EMV function name**|**Command**|
|:--------------------|:----------|
|Initialize card                  |SELECT FILE "1PAY.SYS.DDF01" / "2PAY.SYS.DDF01"|
|                                |READ RECORD (to read all records in the specified SFI)|
|Application Selection           |SELECT     |
|Initiate Application Processing |GET PROCESSING OPTIONS|
|                                |READ RECORD (all records listed in the AFL)|
|(Read other application data)	  |GET DATA (ATC, Last online ATC, PIN Try Counter, Log Format)|
|Dynamic Data Authentication     |INTERNAL AUTHENTICATE|
|Offline verification		  |VERIFY (only plaintext PIN verification is supported)|
|Read Transaction Log            |GET DATA/READ RECORD|

In addition to this, 'Brute force all SFI+records', 'SELECT Master File' and 'GET CHALLENGE' has been partially implemented

TODO:
  * Exception handling and usage should be reviewed.
  * Refactor generic smart card functions into reusable framework classes
  * Mastercard signed data currently not supported. Add CA Public Keys for Mastercard / Europay (others?)
  * Implement transaction processing
